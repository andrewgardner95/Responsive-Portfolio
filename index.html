      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>This year, I graduated from the University of San Diego with a degree in Accounting with an Information Technology focus. Although I enjoy accounting, particularly the problem solving aspect of it, I wanted to find a career path that involved more creative thinking. Creativity is something that is very important to me and I find that if I donâ€™t utilize the creative side of my brain for a while, I get very bored. After familiarizing myself with front-end web development languages, I realized that coding was a great blend of problem solving and creative thinking. I then enrolled into The Coding Bootcamp at UC San Diego Extension to learn full stack web development and I am now seeking employment opportunities within the tech industry.</p>
      <p>I have worked in a variety of environments, from start-ups to large corporations. From my experience, I have found that I enjoy tight-knit, team-oriented environments with friendly people the most. My favorite part about working is taking on new challenges because, although frustrating, they make for great learning experiences.</p>
      <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy mountain biking, fishing, and listening to music. My biggest passion is traveling and I hope to share my unique perspective of the world with my future coworkers.</p>
